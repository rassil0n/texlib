moepTikZ -  a library for typesetting computer networks
=======================================================

Overview
--------
The moepTikZ package provides shapes for typesetting computer networks, e.g.
shapes for hubs, switches, routers, and more.  It is in use since 2012 for the
lecture materials of our basic course in computer networks \cite{} due to
shortcomings of some commercial products and (at that time) the lack of
meaningful alternatives.  For the first official release many shapes were
redesigned and a couple of new features added, e.g. complete anchor support and
custom colors.


How to compile
--------------
At the moment there is no meaningful Makefile accompanying this package. For
the time being, just run

| pdflatex documentation.tex

*twice* in the document's root directory. Be sure to have an up-to-date TeX
distribution. The package is tested with texlive-full on Linux and MacTeX on
OSX, but it should not make any problems using MiKTeX on Windows.

Installation
------------
At this time meopTikZ is distributed a single .sty file that depends on a
couple of common LaTeX packages. Just copy it to the root of your document and
include it using \usepackage{moeptikz}. An upload to CTAN is planned as soon as
the codebase appears to be "nice".


Feature requests and bug reports
--------------------------------
Both is highly welcome. Please report anything to moepi@moepi.net.
